The Signal Processing for Media Applications (Sigmedia) Group  is a
research group in the [Department of Electronic and Electrical
Engineering](https://tcd.ie/eleceng) at [Trinity College
Dublin](https://tcd.ie/).

## Research

We explore problems that involve visual or audio digital media. Evolving from expertise in digital signal processing, we create solutions
based on a healthy smoothy of statistics, probabilistic inference and applied mathematics. The team operates in well recognised domains: 
computer vision, image/video/audio processing, and speech and language
understanding. There are three main themes

  - Digital Cinema and Restoration
  - Video Compression and Streaming Pipelines
  - Human Speech Communication

We are well known for our work on cinema post-production. Our motion and visual enhancement technologies (in collaboration with
[Foundry](https://foundry.com)) were used around the world for film
post production in movies like The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, X-Men,
Spider Man, Harry Potter. This work was recognised by the
[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2007](https://www.oscars.org/sci-tech/ceremonies/2007) with a Scientific and Engineering Oscar award.


## Collaboration

Sigmedia researchers have been involved with many EU projects over the years
(i3dpost, MOUMIR, PRESTOSPACE) involving archives and broadcasters around Europe. We are currently involved in EU COST Actions
IC1106 and IC1105. A number of our current projects are funded by
Science Foundation Ireland, IRCSET and Enterprise Ireland. We have 
collaborated closely with Industry, including Google/YouTube, DTS, Huawei, Lightstream
Animation and Foundry. The group has had a close association with
Prof. Frank Boland's Audio, Acoustics and Music Research Group, with
many joint projects.
