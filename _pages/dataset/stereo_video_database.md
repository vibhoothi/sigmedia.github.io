## Description

This database is designed to be a resource that provides test data working in the field of stereo cinema post-production. It consists of sequence shot in indoor and outdoor locations and under both controlled and uncontrolled lighting conditions. It also contains footage shot from a steadicam as well as on a tripod.

### The experimental setup

The camera rig consists of two iconix HD-RH1 cameras mounted on an Inition 'bolt' side-by-side rig. The data was capture on Flash XDR units and is recorded in a 4:2:2 XDCAM format using the "xd5e" codec at a rate of 100 Mbps. The spatial resolution of the sequences is 1920 x 1080 and has a frame rate of 25 frames per second.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples of some stereo stills taken from the database. They are at full resolution.

Here are some low resolution sequences that are also in the database.
