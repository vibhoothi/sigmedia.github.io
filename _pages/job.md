Current positions are always listed on the main [TCD webpage](http://www.tcd.ie/vacancies).

Prospective PhD candidates should contact us during their final year of study to
explore funding opportunities. We consider applications from candidates with a
first-class degree (expected) in a numerate discipline e.g. Electronics,
Computer Science or Mathematics. Experience in signal processing and Matlab is a
distinct advantage. Please send a short CV and motivation letter, including the
names of at least 2 referees, to prospective Advisors listed on the Teams page.

For postdoctoral positions, these posts will be advertised on the main TCD web pages. It is always worth contacting us a few months in advance of your potential availability if you believe your research is a particularly good match for the Lab.

We frequently take on talented interns. See our Research page to get an overview of the research in the group.
